# Quick-AHK-Script-AimAssist
A auto hot key script I made that helps manage recoil and auto-crouching in FPS games. You'll need AHK for this. This simple script automatically drags your mouse downwards at an adjustable rate and also pushes lCtrl for you when you shoot, useful for games similar to CSGO. Some game anti cheats may detect you and ban you, so don't use this in protected games.
